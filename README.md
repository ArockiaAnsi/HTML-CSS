# HTML-CSS

###Introduction
In this module you will learn to write and understand basic HTML(5) and CSS syntax.
Also we will go into the DOM and file structure. There will be time spent on why and how you use different programming languages (like CSS and HTML). When it comes to CSS you should understand how CSS decides which rules are applied, also you should have an understanding what is meant by elements and attributes. Making responsive websites is an important part of front-end programming. You will learn how to make your websites responsive by using media queries using a “mobile first” approach. Also you will get familiar with developer tools that help make this process easier. During this entire module you’ll (learn to) work in a text editor. It’s expected from you that your code is properly styled using the style guide for HTML/CSS. You’ll be introduced to the inspector that helps you debug and understand you code better.
